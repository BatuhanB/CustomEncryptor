# CustomEncryptor
This project aims to generate custom encrypted password using basic algorithms logic.
## What are the encryption algorithms based on ?
The methods you'll see in this projects based on the ASC II table.
- So basically we have a string type password.
- Then we converts this string to char. 
- After that we find the decimal equivalents of our chars in ASC II. 
- We also add these converted values to our StringBuilder and return.
### ( Not all the methods are same but generally all of them based on the logic above. )
